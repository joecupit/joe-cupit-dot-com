	<p>In October 2025 I started my PhD at the <a class="block-link" href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Manchester,</a> working on machine learning optimisation of manufacturing operations in chemical engineering.</p>
	<p>I did a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics before this.</p>
	<p>(More information will be added here as my research progresses.)</p>
